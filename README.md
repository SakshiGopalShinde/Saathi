---

## Project Vision ✨

Saathi is built to address the growing mental health challenges among students by making support:

- Accessible  
- Confidential  
- Culturally relevant  
- Proactive  

Instead of fragmented solutions, Saathi provides an integrated platform that combines AI-based first aid with professional and peer support.

## Motivation

### The Unmet Need
Mental health concerns among students are increasing rapidly, while support systems remain fragmented and generic.

### The Accessibility Gap
Traditional counselling often faces barriers such as stigma, limited availability, and scheduling conflicts.

### The Digital Disconnect
Many mental health apps are Western-centric, subscription-based, and disconnected from campus counsellors or local language support.

### The Need for Proactive Insight
Institutions lack real-time anonymized data to detect stress trends and intervene early.

---

## Core Objectives 🎯

### AI Compass
An emotionally aware chatbot using NLP and clinical tools like **PHQ-9 and GAD-7** to guide students toward appropriate help.

### Seamless Connection
A confidential booking system linking students directly to campus counsellors.

### Culturally Curated Wellness
A multilingual resource hub with videos, exercises, and guides tailored for regional languages.

### Proactive Campus Insight
An admin dashboard providing anonymized analytics to help institutions make data-driven interventions.

### Combining Tech and Humanity
A platform that merges AI-driven support with human care through counsellors and peer networks.
